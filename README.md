## Overview
When launched, the sample presents a view of Microsoft’s Redmond headquarters and the player is then able to move the view about by dragging their finger across the display. The sample only presents a limited area surrounding the initial position. However, by tapping the display it is possible to enter a new location for the sample to focus on. A button at the top left of the display allows switching between aerial and road views.


## Extending the Sample
It is possible to change both the displayed map’s zoom scale and the size of the area retrieved by modifying the sample code.
